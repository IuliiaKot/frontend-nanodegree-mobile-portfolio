## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

###About
The task for this project was to optimize [Cameron Pittman's portfolio](https://github.com/gosukiwi/web-performance-portfolio) page for speed.

### How to run
To get started, download the frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio entire folder, and open it in a browser locally.

### Page load speed optimization
- Minifying CSS/JS: all CSS and JS files were minified. CSS are inlined. The original file also present in the folder witout .min

### Frame optimization
- Loop optimization: unnecessary JS operations were pulled out of `for` loops where possible.
